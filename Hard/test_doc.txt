Underlying Assumptions

1. The two stocks are highly correlated with one another and the cause of a movement in one is likely to have a similar effect on the other
2. The previous year's data provides a suitable length window of information with which to make predictions about future movements
3. The ratio of the two stocks is likely to regress to the mean after any osciallation
4. The ratio of one stock to another being significantly under the recent average value indicates the strong possibility that the value of this stock will rise soon and vice versa
5. It is favourable to buy a stock when there is a strong possibility it will rise soon, and to short sell it in the opposite case
6. It is favourable to close a buy trade when the possibility for the stock to rise weakens, and to close a short trade in the opposite case

Positive Attributes

1. The strategy has a clear algorithmic format using reliable indicators
2. The strategy is simple to implement
3. The stategy works well for stocks which tend to trade at prices close to the mean with some oscillation

Risk attributes

1. The strategy is not suited to certain stocks, for example those which often trade at prices far from the mean
2. The strategy uses the past values of two stocks as the only indicators of future stock price
3. The strategy uses a fixed, arbitrary window of data from which to calculate the mean

Possible improvements

1. Incorporate other price indicators such as Exponential Moving Average or Momentum
2. Include other related stocks or further external numerical information 
3. Account for volatility using Bollinger Bands
