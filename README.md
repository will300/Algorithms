# Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of algorithms coded in Python for copying, chopping up, translating etc wherever they may be of use. The output of each file is the success status of a set of test cases.

The list of problems is taken from the final two question chapters of the book *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

The following is a list of short descriptions for each problem

### Moderate
* **number_swapper.py**: swap two array elements in-place
* **word_frequencies.py**: find all word frequencies from a long text
* **intersection.py**: find the point of intersection of two straight lines
* **tic_tac_win.py**: win status of noughts and crosses game
* **factorial_zeros.py**: number trailing zeros in n factorial 
* **smallest_difference.py**: pair of integers from separate arrays with smallest non-negative difference
* **number_max.py**: maximum of two numbers without built-in functions or conditional statements
* **english_int.py**: generate written english for any integer

* **diving_board.py**: all possible sums comprising a particular count of a small and a large integer
* **xml_encoding.py**: standard xml encoding
* **master_mind.py**: return hit and pseudo hit totals in a game of master mind
* **sub_sort.py**: find smallest subsequence to sort to make array sorted
* **contiguous_sequence.py**: contiguous sequence within array with largest sum
